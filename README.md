Bricks Breaking
===============

This is a Java implementation of the game Bricks Breaking. I worked on this project when the game was very
popular on Facebook and I wanted to see if Monte-Carlo Tree Search would be a good algorithm to play
the game. It turned out that the game is so simple that even vanilla Monte Carlo simulations
(uniformly random) played extremelly well.
